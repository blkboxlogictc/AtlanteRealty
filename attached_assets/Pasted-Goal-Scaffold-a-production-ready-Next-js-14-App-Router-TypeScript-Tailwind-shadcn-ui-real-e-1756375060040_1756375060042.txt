Goal: Scaffold a production-ready Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui real-estate website for Atlante that unifies four lines of business and links out where needed. Create clean, mobile-first UI inspired by treasurecoastcommercialrealestate.com (Services depth) and fragaproperties.com (polish + large visuals). Site will embed/ integrate IDXBroker for MLS search & listings.
