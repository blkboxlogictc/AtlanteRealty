    "content": "<p>The Treasure Coast real estate market continues to show resilience and growth as we head into 2025. Our analysis of recent market data reveals several key trends that will shape the coming year.</p>\n\n<h2>Market Overview</h2>\n<p>The Treasure Coast has experienced steady appreciation in home values, with the median home price increasing by 8.2% year-over-year. This growth has been driven by continued migration to Florida, limited inventory, and strong employment growth in the region.</p>\n\n<h2>Key Trends to Watch</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Inventory Stabilization:</strong> We're seeing a gradual increase in available homes, which should provide more options for buyers while moderating price growth.</li>\n<li><strong>Interest Rate Impact:</strong> Current mortgage rates are affecting buyer behavior, with many choosing to refinance existing properties rather than purchase new ones.</li>\n<li><strong>Commercial Growth:</strong> The commercial sector is experiencing significant expansion, particularly in the technology and healthcare sectors.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Buyer and Seller Insights</h2>\n<p>For buyers, the market offers more negotiating power than we've seen in recent years. Sellers are adjusting expectations and pricing more competitively to attract serious buyers.</p>\n\n<p>Our recommendation for 2025 is to work with experienced local agents who understand these market nuances and can help navigate the changing landscape effectively.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The home inspection is a crucial step in the real estate transaction process. Understanding what's involved can help both buyers and sellers navigate this important milestone successfully.</p>\n\n<h2>What is a Home Inspection?</h2>\n<p>A home inspection is a thorough examination of a property's condition, typically conducted by a licensed professional. The inspection covers major systems and components of the home, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Structural elements (foundation, framing, roof)</li>\n<li>Electrical systems and components</li>\n<li>Plumbing systems and fixtures</li>\n<li>HVAC systems and ductwork</li>\n<li>Interior and exterior components</li>\n<li>Insulation and ventilation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>For Buyers</h2>\n<p>As a buyer, the inspection period is your opportunity to identify any potential issues before finalizing the purchase. Here's what to expect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Timing:</strong> Inspections typically occur within 7-10 days of contract acceptance</li>\n<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Expect 2-4 hours depending on the property size</li>\n<li><strong>Attendance:</strong> Buyers are encouraged to attend and ask questions</li>\n<li><strong>Report:</strong> You'll receive a detailed written report within 24-48 hours</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>For Sellers</h2>\n<p>Sellers can prepare for inspections by addressing obvious maintenance issues and ensuring easy access to all areas of the home:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Test all systems and appliances</li>\n<li>Replace burnt-out light bulbs</li>\n<li>Clear access to electrical panels and water heater</li>\n<li>Address minor repairs and maintenance issues</li>\n<li>Provide documentation for recent improvements</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>After the Inspection</h2>\n<p>The inspection report may reveal items requiring attention. Buyers and sellers can negotiate repairs, credits, or price adjustments based on the findings. Most issues can be resolved through good-faith negotiations.</p>\n\n<p>Working with experienced agents ensures the inspection process proceeds smoothly and protects everyone's interests.</p>",
